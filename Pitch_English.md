# AON: Decentralized AI, Sovereign Quantum Security, and Lifetime Connectivity

---

### The Current Problem

**Critical infrastructures** (finance, defense, healthcare) are increasingly exposed to cyber risks and the imminent threat of **quantum computing attacks**. Current AI solutions are **centralized**, do not comply with **international risk management standards (ISO 31000)**, and lack the robustness required against the next generation of threats.

### Our Unique Solution: AON

AON is the **world's first decentralized AI infrastructure** integrating an unprecedented value proposition:

* **Lifetime Global Connectivity:** Each **AON token** (with an ultra-limited supply of **5,000 units**) represents a **lifetime satellite and terrestrial eSIM global connectivity**, eliminating barriers and recurring bills for its holders.
* **Post-Quantum Security (PQM):** Proven resistance against quantum computing attacks, ensuring long-term integrity and confidentiality (Kyber, Dilithium).
* **ISO 31000 Risk Management & Real-Time Forensic Auditing:** Native integration of risk management standards and an AI engine for **real-time anomaly detection and active forensic auditing**.
* **Digital Sovereignty (SSI & Web3 DID):** Based on **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Web3 Decentralized Identifiers (DID)**, ensuring full user control over their data and identity.
* **Advanced Hybrid Decentralized Architecture:** **Blockchain + satellite networks + Web3** for operational resilience that functions even outside conventional internet infrastructure. Includes robust **Secure Identity and Device Management (SM-DP+)** linked to risk standards.

### Target Market

We target sectors where AI and connectivity security, sovereignty, and resilience are critical:

* **Governments and Defense:** Secure, auditable, and sovereign artificial intelligence and communication systems.
* **Financial Institutions:** Robust risk management, regulatory compliance, and transaction security with AI.
* **Technology Companies and IoT Projects:** A robust platform for building secure, decentralized AI applications, as well as lifetime connectivity solutions for devices.
* **Emerging Markets (Africa & Latin America):** We initiate the democratization of connectivity in regions with high demand for affordable and reliable access.

### Tokenomics (AON Token)

* **Total Supply:** **5,000 AON tokens** (each a lifetime global connectivity eSIM).
* **Distribution:**
    * Community & Rewards: 35%
    * DEX Liquidity: 30%
    * Private Sale: 15%
    * Team & Advisors: 15% (with rigorous *vesting* and **value-adjusted compensation** decided by the DAO).
    * Development Fund (DAO Treasury): 5%.
* **Sustainability:** Transactions within the ecosystem include **fees** that fund development, ongoing community rewards, and an **automatic token burn** to ensure long-term scarcity and sustainability.

---

### Roadmap (4-8 months)

* **Month 1-2:** Architecture design and Micro-OS PoC. Initial PQC implementation (Kyber, Dilithium).
* **Month 3:** Private Sale launch with investor presentations and initial *partners*.
* **Month 4:** Public announcement of the **open-source** repository + **ISO 31000 certification pre-launch**.
* **Month 5-8:** Community expansion, strategic alliances, final certification, and advanced development of AI and connectivity components.

---

### Competitive Advantage

* **Global Pioneers:** The **world's first decentralized AI** integrating **ISO 31000 + PQM + Lifetime Connectivity** in a single token.
* **Holistic Security Focus:** We prioritize **real security**, **real-time auditing**, and **regulatory compliance**, transcending mere technological *hype*.
* **Extreme Resilience:** Hybrid integration for uninterrupted operation across **satellite and mesh networks**.
