# AON Tokenomics

---

This document details the proposed economy for the AON token, designed to empower the decentralized governance and sustainability of our revolutionary global connectivity infrastructure. As an open-source, community-defined project, these tokenomics are the starting point and are subject to the evolution and voting of the AON DAO.

## 1. Token Vision and Utility: Access, Governance, Security, and Active Participation

The AON token is not just a cryptocurrency; it is the key to a new era of digital sovereignty and high-value connectivity. Its strategically managed supply, released in phases, and its fundamental utility establish it as a digital asset of growing exclusivity and exceptional value.

* [cite_start]**Lifetime Global Connectivity (Phased Exclusive Asset):** Each AON token grants a **lifetime right to global connectivity (satellite and terrestrial eSIM)** within the AON ecosystem[cite: 102, 150]. [cite_start]This is a fundamental and highly exclusive digital asset that eliminates barriers and recurring monthly bills for its holders, symbolizing sovereignty over personal connectivity[cite: 102, 150]. [cite_start]The number of available eSIMs will grow strategically with token release phases, aligning with network expansion[cite: 103, 150].
* [cite_start]**Decentralized Governance (DAO):** AON token holders will have voting power in the [AON DAO](https://github.com/magicalons/AON/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) (suggested link to a future governance file), allowing them to collectively define the project's future[cite: 120, 270]. [cite_start]This includes everything from usage policies and data limits, to infrastructure evolution and treasury fund allocation, ensuring the project remains truly community-driven[cite: 120, 262, 270].
* **Active Post-Quantum Security (PQC) Validation and Rewards:** Once the AON application is active with an initial user base (e.g., 20-100 users), they can actively participate in the **decentralized validation of PQC certificates and other critical security processes** through their devices. For every 'X' validations or contributions to network security, they will receive **rewards in AON tokens or fractions thereof**. These tokens can be used within the ecosystem, exchanged for other assets or services, or held for governance rights and connectivity, directly incentivizing community participation in network robustness and resilience.
* [cite_start]**Access to Advanced Security Services:** AON's AI provides **real-time forensic auditing and anomaly detection**, with a focus on post-quantum security (PQC)[cite: 105, 155]. The community will decide whether these critical security services are offered as a common good for token holders, or if certain advanced functionalities will require the use or *staking* of additional tokens to maintain network sustainability and value.

## 2. Supply and Initial Distribution: Strategic Growth and Controlled Value

[cite_start]The AON token supply is designed for strategic phased growth, reflecting its exclusive and high-value nature as the ecosystem expands[cite: 119, 199, 264]. Its limited offering in each phase ensures that each token is a prized asset, aligned with the network's expansion capacity.

* [cite_start]**Initial Supply (Phase 1):** **5,000 (five thousand) AON tokens.** These are the initial tokens to be distributed[cite: 119, 150, 241].

* [cite_start]**Distribution Allocation (Phase 1 - 5,000 tokens):** Percentages apply to this initial supply, seeking a balance between liquidity, development, rewards, and funding[cite: 242].

    * [cite_start]**Community and Rewards:** **35% (1,750 tokens)** [cite: 122, 243]
        * [cite_start]Intended to reward early and high-value participation, *open source* contributions (code, documentation, translations), *bug bounty* programs, and **rewards for active PQC security validation** and active participation in governance and community channels[cite: 244].
        * [cite_start]*Objective:* To build a highly engaged user base that will be the driving force of the project, given the initial exclusivity of the asset[cite: 245].
    * [cite_start]**DEX Liquidity:** **30% (1,500 tokens)** [cite: 123, 246]
        * [cite_start]Allocated to provide initial liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEX), ensuring a healthy and accessible market for the AON token from launch[cite: 247]. [cite_start]This is crucial for adoption and price discovery[cite: 248].
    * [cite_start]**Private Sale:** **15% (750 tokens)** [cite: 124, 249]
        * [cite_start]Aimed at strategic investors and initial partners who contribute capital and long-term value to the project[cite: 250]. [cite_start]These funds will be used to drive development and expansion[cite: 251].
    * [cite_start]**Team and Advisors:** **15% (750 tokens)** [cite: 125, 251]
        * [cite_start]Intended to reward and retain the founding team and key advisors[cite: 252]. [cite_start]These tokens will be subject to a rigorous **vesting schedule** to align their interests with the long-term success of the project[cite: 253]. [cite_start]A common model includes an **initial lock-up (cliff) of 6 to 12 months**, followed by **linear release over an additional 2 to 4 years**[cite: 254]. [cite_start]For advisors and key contributors, more agile vesting models may apply, such as **weekly or bi-weekly deliveries over 4 to 6 months** after an initial commitment period, to encourage continuous dedication[cite: 255].
        * [cite_start]**Value-Adjusted Compensation (Post-Initial Vesting):** After the completion of the initial vesting schedule (e.g., the first 4 months), the AON DAO may vote to approve **additional token releases** for key collaborators, **adjusted to the current market price** of the AON token[cite: 256]. [cite_start]This mechanism seeks to ensure that the real value of the compensation is maintained, incentivizing continuous commitment and protecting collaborators from market volatility[cite: 257]. [cite_start]The implementation of this mechanism, including its parameters (e.g., target fiat value, adjustment frequency, maximum token release limits by this means), will be subject to **detailed proposals and DAO voting**, ensuring transparent and controlled management of the token supply[cite: 258, 259].
    * [cite_start]**Development Fund (DAO Treasury):** **5% (250 tokens)** [cite: 126, 260]
        * [cite_start]An initial fund to cover essential development expenses, PQC research, security audits (including ISO 31000 for risk management), and critical operational needs[cite: 261]. [cite_start]This fund will be transparently managed and audited by the DAO, ensuring project sustainability[cite: 262].

### 2.2. Supply Expansion Phases: Towards a Total of 20,000 Tokens (Initially)

[cite_start]To finance infrastructure expansion, advanced development, and attract key new talent for AON's evolution, the total token supply will be strategically expanded over controlled phases[cite: 119, 264, 265].

* [cite_start]**Additional Supply (Phases 2 and 3):** An issuance of **15,000 additional tokens** is planned to cover the expansion[cite: 265].
    * [cite_start]**Purpose:** These tokens will primarily be used to finance infrastructure expansion (bandwidth acquisition, alliances with SM-DP+ and operators), advanced development of AON components, and the attraction of key new talent for ecosystem evolution[cite: 266].
    * [cite_start]**Timing and Mechanism:** These releases will be carried out strategically, taking into account the token's market value at that time to maximize effective funding and talent acquisition on competitive terms[cite: 267]. [cite_start]The DAO will define the exact details of the timing (in the next 2 to 4 months after phase 1), the division between phase 2 and 3, and the issuance/sale mechanisms for these additional tokens[cite: 268].
* [cite_start]**Final Total Supply (Pre-Phase 4):** The total supply of AON tokens will reach **20,000 units** after the completion of Phase 3[cite: 119, 269]. [cite_start]Each of these tokens will continue to represent a lifetime right to global connectivity[cite: 269].
* [cite_start]**Phase 4 and Beyond (Community Governance):** Any future expansion of the AON token supply beyond the initial 20,000 tokens (and, therefore, the number of additional eSIMs) will be **decided and governed entirely by the AON DAO through a transparent voting process**[cite: 120, 270, 271]. [cite_start]This ensures that ecosystem growth is always aligned with the community's vision and needs[cite: 271].

### 2.3. Sustainability Mechanisms and Transaction Fees

[cite_start]To ensure ecosystem sustainability and token value, a small transaction fee will be applied, designed to be efficient and non-intrusive[cite: 127, 273].

* [cite_start]**Transaction Fees:** Transactions within the AON ecosystem (e.g., token transfers, interactions with smart contracts related to services) will incur small *fees*[cite: 274]. [cite_start]The distribution of these *fees* will be designed to balance growth and sustainability[cite: 275]:
    * [cite_start]**Development Fund and DAO Treasury:** A portion of these *fees* will be directed to the DAO Treasury to fund continuous development, bandwidth acquisition from satellite/terrestrial providers, and community rewards, ensuring a sustainable growth cycle[cite: 276].
    * [cite_start]**Automatic Burning:** Another portion of the *fees* will be subject to **automatic burning**, permanently reducing the total token supply[cite: 127, 277]. [cite_start]This deflationary mechanism seeks to increase scarcity and, potentially, the long-term value of the AON token[cite: 278]. [cite_start]The exact proportion of *fees* allocated to burning will be defined and adjustable by community vote, allowing for dynamic adaptation to market conditions[cite: 279].
    * [cite_start]**Automatic Liquidity (Potential):** A portion could be redirected to DEX liquidity pools, helping to maintain the depth and stability of the AON token's liquidity[cite: 280].
    * [cite_start]**Rewards for Holders (Potential):** A small portion could be distributed among AON token holders, incentivizing long-term *holding* and participation in *staking* programs[cite: 281].

* [cite_start]***Staking* (Future Potential):** The community could vote to implement *staking* mechanisms where AON token holders lock their tokens to keep their eSIM active (if an "activation" by *staking* model is decided), or to gain greater governance rights or additional rewards for securing the network and its services[cite: 282].
