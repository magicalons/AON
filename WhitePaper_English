## Executive Summary

[cite_start]In today's digital age, the critical infrastructures that sustain our societies—from financial systems and defense networks to healthcare—stand at an unprecedented crossroads of vulnerability[cite: 52]. [cite_start]The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, coupled with the imminent threat of quantum computing, exposes these infrastructures to catastrophic risks[cite: 53]. [cite_start]Existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, predominantly centralized and lacking global risk standardization, are not only intrinsically vulnerable but also lack the resilience and trust necessary to protect invaluable assets[cite: 54].

[cite_start]**AON** emerges as the pioneering answer to this existential challenge[cite: 55]. [cite_start]We are the world's first **decentralized** Artificial Intelligence platform, specifically designed to operate with unparalleled security, auditability, and resilience[cite: 56]. [cite_start]Our solution is founded on innovative pillars and a unique value proposition[cite: 57]:

1.  [cite_start]**Lifetime Global Connectivity (Exclusive Asset):** With a supply strategically managed in phases (starting with 5,000 units and expanding to 20,000 for global infrastructure, with future phases decided by the community), each AON token represents a **lifetime global satellite and terrestrial connectivity eSIM**, eliminating barriers and recurring bills and symbolizing sovereignty over personal connectivity[cite: 10, 58].
2.  [cite_start]**Integrated ISO 31000 Certification:** We incorporate the ISO 31000 international risk management standard from design, guaranteeing a robust framework for risk identification, analysis, evaluation, and treatment[cite: 59]. [cite_start]This not only ensures regulatory compliance but also instills indispensable trust for adoption by businesses and governments[cite: 60].
3.  [cite_start]**Native Post-Quantum Security (PQM):** Anticipating the era of quantum computing, AON implements cryptographic algorithms resistant to quantum attacks (Kyber, Dilithium)[cite: 61]. [cite_start]This ensures the long-term integrity and confidentiality of data and operations, protecting against future threats that would invalidate current cryptographies[cite: 62].
4.  [cite_start]**Real-Time Forensic Audit & Digital Sovereignty (SSI & Web3 DID):** A decentralized AI engine allows for real-time anomaly detection and active forensic auditing[cite: 63]. [cite_start]This is built upon Self-Sovereign Digital Identity (SSI) and Web3 Decentralized Identifiers (DID), guaranteeing full user control over their data and identity[cite: 64].
5.  [cite_start]**Advanced Hybrid Architecture:** Our platform combines the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology with the resilience and global reach of satellite networks and Web3 principles[cite: 65]. [cite_start]This synergy allows AON to operate continuously and securely, even in scenarios of conventional connectivity interruption, offering unprecedented operational capability outside the traditional internet, including robust Secure Identity and Device Management (SM-DP+) linked to risk standards[cite: 66].
6.  [cite_start]**Expansion Strategy and Strategic Alliances:** AON does not seek to unilaterally replace existing infrastructure[cite: 67]. [cite_start]Our model is designed for **interoperability** and **strategic collaboration**[cite: 68]. [cite_start]We will actively seek mergers or alliances with established telephone companies and SM-DP+ providers to leverage their infrastructure and operational expertise, enabling faster and more efficient global scalability of AON eSIMs, while maintaining our principles of decentralization, sovereignty, and security[cite: 69].

[cite_start]AON's target market encompasses critical sectors such as **Governments and Defense**, **Financial Institutions**, and **Technology Companies**, all of which have an urgent need for secure, auditable, and standard-compliant AI solutions[cite: 70]. [cite_start]The AON token is the economic engine of this ecosystem, facilitating transactions, incentivizing community participation, and financing continuous development through a sustainable tokenomics model that includes fees and burning mechanisms[cite: 71].

[cite_start]With an ambitious roadmap that foresees the development of the smart contract, a functional AI MVP with PQM, and ISO 31000 certification in the initial months, AON not only aims to be a leader in AI security but also to establish a new global standard for the digital infrastructure of the future[cite: 72]. [cite_start]We are seeking an initial investment of between €50,000 and €100,000 to catalyze development, secure key certifications, and expand our community[cite: 73].

## 1. Problem Statement

[cite_start]The global digital infrastructure, the backbone of the economy, national security, and essential services, faces an unprecedented escalation in the complexity and frequency of cyber threats[cite: 75]. [cite_start]Beyond conventional attacks, the imminent arrival of quantum computing presents an existential risk that could dismantle the foundations of modern cryptography, exposing systems we currently consider impregnable[cite: 76].

### 1.1. Vulnerability of Critical Infrastructures

[cite_start]Sectors such as finance, defense, energy, and healthcare are primary targets due to the value and sensitivity of their data and operations[cite: 78]. [cite_start]A successful attack not only implies massive economic losses but can destabilize nations, compromise the privacy of millions of citizens, and paralyze vital services[cite: 79]. Recent reports from cybersecurity agencies and risk analysis firms highlight:

* [cite_start]**Increase in sophisticated attacks:** Ransomware, supply chain attacks, and APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) targeting critical infrastructures have grown exponentially, with an average cost per data breach exceeding millions of dollars[cite: 81].
* [cite_start]**Reliance on legacy systems:** Many critical infrastructures operate with older systems that were not designed to withstand current threats, creating blind spots and vulnerabilities difficult to patch[cite: 82].
* [cite_start]**Lack of global standardization:** The absence of a unified and globally adopted framework for risk management in the field of AI and cybersecurity hinders interoperability and trust between entities and nations[cite: 83].

### 1.2. The Quantum Threat

[cite_start]Quantum computing, although still in its early stages, represents a disruptive threat to information security[cite: 85]. [cite_start]Quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm, have the potential to break public-key cryptography (RSA, ECC) and symmetric cryptography (AES) in the foreseeable future[cite: 86]. This means that:

* [cite_start]**Compromised communications and historical data:** Information encrypted today could be retroactively decrypted once quantum computers become sufficiently powerful[cite: 88].
* [cite_start]**Invalid digital signatures:** The authentication of financial transactions, digital identities, and secure communications could be forged, undermining trust in the entire digital ecosystem[cite: 89].
* [cite_start]**Critical infrastructures at direct risk:** Industrial control systems, power grids, and sensitive databases that rely on current cryptography would be exposed[cite: 90].

### 1.3. Limitations of Centralized AI Solutions

Current Artificial Intelligence implementations, while powerful, present inherent deficiencies that make them unsuitable for the protection of critical infrastructures:

* [cite_start]**Single Points of Failure:** The centralization of data and AI models creates attractive targets for attackers[cite: 93]. [cite_start]A compromise in a central node can paralyze the entire system[cite: 94].
* [cite_start]**Lack of transparency and auditability:** "Black box" models of centralized AI make independent auditing and verification of their behavior difficult, which is unacceptable in regulated and high-security environments[cite: 95].
* [cite_start]**Privacy risks:** The massive aggregation of data on central servers increases the risk of privacy breaches and misuse of information[cite: 96].
* [cite_start]**Vulnerability to manipulation:** Centralized AI models can be susceptible to data poisoning or model manipulation attacks, compromising the integrity of their decisions[cite: 97].
* [cite_start]**Incompatibility with risk standards:** Most AI solutions are not intrinsically designed to comply with risk management frameworks such as ISO 31000, which hinders their adoption in business and government environments that demand rigorous compliance[cite: 98].

[cite_start]The sum of these vulnerabilities creates a critical gap in global digital security, a gap that current solutions cannot effectively close[cite: 99]. [cite_start]AON is positioned to address this void with a radically new approach[cite: 100].

## 2. Our Unique Solution: AON

[cite_start]AON is not just a technological platform; it is a next-generation security and connectivity infrastructure designed to counteract current and future threats[cite: 102]. [cite_start]Our solution is distinguished by the synergistic integration of advanced technologies and a decentralized governance model[cite: 104].

### 2.1. Lifetime Global Connectivity via the AON Token

[cite_start]At the heart of AON's value proposition lies the AON token[cite: 106]. [cite_start]With a **supply that will strategically expand in phases** (starting with 5,000 units and growing to a total of 20,000 to finance global expansion, and with future expansions governed by the DAO), each AON token represents a **lifetime right to global connectivity**, materialized through a **satellite and terrestrial eSIM**[cite: 107]. [cite_start]This model eliminates the need for contracts, monthly bills, and *roaming* concerns, offering true sovereignty over personal connectivity[cite: 108].

### 2.2. Integrated ISO 31000 Certification

[cite_start]We implement the ISO 31000 international standard for risk management from the earliest design and development phases[cite: 110]. [cite_start]This ensures that every component of AON, from the micro-OS to the smart contracts, is developed with a proactive risk mindset[cite: 111]. [cite_start]ISO 31000 certification not only validates our commitment to security and resilience but also provides the trust and compliance framework necessary for adoption by governments, financial institutions, and large enterprises[cite: 112].

### 2.3. Native Post-Quantum Security (PQM)

[cite_start]Anticipating the era of quantum computing, AON incorporates cryptographic algorithms resistant to quantum attacks (PQM)[cite: 114]. [cite_start]We have selected and implemented robust algorithms such as **Kyber** for public-key encryption and **Dilithium** for digital signatures, both recommended by NIST[cite: 115]. [cite_start]This ensures that communications, data, and identities within the AON ecosystem remain secure and confidential in the long term, even against the threat of large-scale quantum computers[cite: 116].

### 2.4. Real-Time Forensic Audit and Decentralized Artificial Intelligence

[cite_start]AON integrates a decentralized Artificial Intelligence engine designed for **integrity validation and real-time anomaly detection**[cite: 118]. [cite_start]This AI not only monitors network and device behavior but also performs **active forensic auditing**, identifying attack patterns and emerging vulnerabilities[cite: 119]. [cite_start]By being decentralized, this AI avoids single points of failure and improves transparency and resistance to manipulation[cite: 120].

### 2.5. Digital Sovereignty with SSI and Web3 DID

[cite_start]Digital identity in AON is based on the principles of **Self-Sovereign Digital Identity (SSI)** and **Web3 Decentralized Identifiers (DID)**[cite: 122]. [cite_start]This allows users to have total and auditable control over their data and identities, without depending on centralized authorities[cite: 123]. [cite_start]The robust linkage between these identities and physical devices is achieved through eSIM profiles securely managed via **SM-DP+**, ensuring that connectivity provision is intrinsically linked to user sovereignty and risk management standards[cite: 124].

### 2.6. Advanced Hybrid Architecture for Extreme Resilience

[cite_start]AON operates on a unique hybrid architecture that combines the immutability of **blockchain technology** with the resilience and global reach of **satellite networks** and the principles of **Web3**[cite: 126]. [cite_start]This synergy allows AON to function continuously and securely, even in scenarios of conventional connectivity interruption or targeted attacks on terrestrial infrastructures[cite: 127]. [cite_start]The integration of additional *mesh* networks further enhances this unprecedented operational capability[cite: 128].

### 2.7. Expansion Strategy and Strategic Alliances

[cite_start]AON does not seek to unilaterally replace existing infrastructure[cite: 130]. [cite_start]Our model is designed for **interoperability** and **strategic collaboration**[cite: 130]. [cite_start]We will actively seek mergers or alliances with established telephone companies and SM-DP+ providers to leverage their infrastructure and operational expertise, enabling faster and more efficient global scalability of AON eSIMs, while maintaining our principles of decentralization, sovereignty, and security[cite: 131].

## 4. Tokenomics Model (AON Token Economy)

[cite_start]The AON token is the economic heart of the AON ecosystem, designed to incentivize participation, fund development, and ensure the long-term sustainability of the project, reflecting its exclusive and high-value nature[cite: 147].

### 4.1. Total Supply and Initial Distribution

* [cite_start]**Initial Supply (Phase 1):** **5,000 (five thousand) AON tokens.** This initial supply underscores the exclusivity and high value of each unit, given that each token represents a lifetime global connectivity eSIM[cite: 149].

* [cite_start]**Distribution Allocation (Phase 1 - 5,000 tokens):** Percentages have been proportionally adjusted for this initial supply, seeking a balance between liquidity, development, rewards, and funding[cite: 150].

    * [cite_start]**Community and Rewards:** **35% (1,750 tokens)** [cite: 151]
        * [cite_start]Intended to reward early and high-value participation, open-source contributions (code, documentation, translations), bug bounty programs, and rewards for active participation in governance and community channels[cite: 152].
        * [cite_start]*Objective:* To build a highly engaged user base that will be the driving force of the project, given the exclusivity of the asset[cite: 153].
    * [cite_start]**DEX Liquidity:** **30% (1,500 tokens)** [cite: 154]
        * [cite_start]Allocated to provide initial liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEX), ensuring a healthy and accessible market for the AON token from launch[cite: 155]. [cite_start]This is crucial for adoption and price discovery[cite: 156].
    * [cite_start]**Private Sale:** **15% (750 tokens)** [cite: 157]
        * [cite_start]Aimed at strategic investors and initial partners who contribute capital and long-term value to the project[cite: 158]. [cite_start]These funds will be used to drive development and expansion[cite: 159].
    * [cite_start]**Team and Advisors:** **15% (750 tokens)** [cite: 159]
        * [cite_start]Intended to reward and retain the founding team and key advisors[cite: 160]. [cite_start]These tokens will be subject to a rigorous **vesting schedule** to align their interests with the long-term success of the project[cite: 161]. [cite_start]A common model includes an **initial lock-up (cliff) of 6 to 12 months**, followed by **linear release over an additional 2 to 4 years**[cite: 162]. [cite_start]For advisors and key contributors, more agile vesting models may apply, such as **weekly or bi-weekly deliveries over 4 to 6 months** after an initial commitment period, to encourage continuous dedication[cite: 163].
        * [cite_start]**Value-Adjusted Compensation (Post-Initial Vesting):** After the completion of the initial vesting schedule (e.g., the first 4 months), the AON DAO may vote to approve **additional token releases** for key collaborators, **adjusted to the current market price** of the AON token[cite: 164]. [cite_start]This mechanism seeks to ensure that the real value of the compensation is maintained, incentivizing continuous commitment and protecting collaborators from market volatility[cite: 165]. [cite_start]The implementation of this mechanism, including its parameters (e.g., target fiat value, adjustment frequency, maximum token release limits by this means), will be subject to **detailed proposals and DAO voting**, ensuring transparent and controlled management of the token supply[cite: 167].
    * [cite_start]**Development Fund (DAO Treasury):** **5% (250 tokens)** [cite: 168]
        * [cite_start]An initial fund to cover essential development expenses, PQC research, security audits (including ISO 31000 for risk management), and critical operational needs[cite: 169]. [cite_start]This fund will be transparently managed and audited by the DAO, ensuring project sustainability[cite: 170].

### 4.2. Supply Expansion Phases: Towards a Total of 20,000 Tokens (Initially)

[cite_start]To finance infrastructure expansion, advanced development, and attract key new talent for AON's evolution, the total token supply will be strategically expanded over controlled phases[cite: 172].

* [cite_start]**Additional Supply (Phases 2 and 3):** An issuance of **15,000 additional tokens** is planned to cover the expansion[cite: 173].
    * [cite_start]**Purpose:** These tokens will primarily be used to finance infrastructure expansion (bandwidth acquisition, alliances with SM-DP+ and operators), advanced development of AON components, and the attraction of key new talent for ecosystem evolution[cite: 174].
    * [cite_start]**Timing and Mechanism:** These releases will be carried out strategically, taking into account the token's market value at that time to maximize effective funding and talent acquisition on competitive terms[cite: 175]. [cite_start]The DAO will define the exact details of the timing (in the next 2 to 4 months after phase 1), the division between phase 2 and 3, and the issuance/sale mechanisms for these additional tokens[cite: 176].
* [cite_start]**Final Total Supply (Pre-Phase 4):** The total supply of AON tokens will reach **20,000 units** after the completion of Phase 3[cite: 177]. [cite_start]Each of these tokens will continue to represent a lifetime right to global connectivity[cite: 177].
* [cite_start]**Phase 4 and Beyond (Community Governance):** Any future expansion of the AON token supply beyond the initial 20,000 tokens (and, therefore, the number of additional eSIMs) will be **decided and governed entirely by the AON DAO through a transparent voting process**[cite: 178]. [cite_start]This ensures that ecosystem growth is always aligned with the community's vision and needs[cite: 179].

### 4.3. Sustainability Mechanisms and Transaction Fees

[cite_start]To ensure ecosystem sustainability and token value, a small transaction fee will be applied, designed to be efficient and non-intrusive[cite: 181].

* [cite_start]**Transaction Fees:** Transactions within the AON ecosystem (e.g., token transfers, interactions with smart contracts related to services) will incur small *fees*[cite: 182]. [cite_start]The distribution of these *fees* will be designed to balance growth and sustainability[cite: 183]:
    * [cite_start]**Development Fund and DAO Treasury:** A portion of these *fees* will be directed to the DAO Treasury to fund continuous development, bandwidth acquisition from satellite/terrestrial providers, and community rewards, ensuring a sustainable growth cycle[cite: 184].
    * [cite_start]**Automatic Burning:** Another portion of the *fees* will be subject to **automatic burning**, permanently reducing the total token supply[cite: 185]. [cite_start]This deflationary mechanism seeks to increase scarcity and, potentially, the long-term value of the AON token[cite: 186]. [cite_start]The exact proportion of *fees* allocated to burning will be defined and adjustable by community vote, allowing for dynamic adaptation to market conditions[cite: 187].
    * [cite_start]**Automatic Liquidity (Potential):** A portion could be redirected to DEX liquidity pools, helping to maintain the depth and stability of the AON token's liquidity[cite: 188].
    * [cite_start]**Rewards for Holders (Potential):** A small portion could be distributed among AON token holders, incentivizing long-term *holding* and participation in *staking* programs[cite: 189].

* [cite_start]***Staking* (Future Potential):** The community could vote to implement *staking* mechanisms where AON token holders lock their tokens to keep their eSIM active (if an "activation" by *staking* model is decided), or to gain greater governance rights or additional rewards for securing the network and its services[cite: 190].
