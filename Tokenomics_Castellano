# AON Tokenomics Model: The Decentralized Economy of Sovereignty

The AON token is not merely a digital currency; it is the economic heart and fundamental enabler of the AON ecosystem. Meticulously designed to incentivize active participation, fund sustainable development, and ensure the long-term value of the project, the AON token reflects the exclusive and high-value nature of our proposition.

### 1. Token Name and Symbol
* **Name:** AON
* **Symbol:** AON
* **Standard:** ERC-20 (on the Ethereum blockchain, for the initial sale and liquidity phase).

### 2. Total Supply and Expansion Phases

AON's supply strategy is a key pillar for balancing exclusivity with the scalability of global infrastructure.

* **Initial Supply (Phase 1):** 5,000 (five thousand) AON tokens will be issued as the initial supply. This number underscores the exclusivity and high value of each unit, given that each token represents a lifetime access right to global connectivity.
* **Controlled Supply Expansion (Phases 2 and 3):** To fund the expansion of global infrastructure (bandwidth acquisition, alliances with SM-DP+ providers and operators), advanced development, and the attraction of key talent, the total token supply will be strategically expanded through controlled phases.
    * The emission of 15,000 additional tokens is planned, bringing the total supply to 20,000 AON tokens after the completion of Phase 3.
    * The exact timing and mechanism of these releases will be defined by the DAO, taking into account the token's market value to maximize effective funding and talent acquisition.
* **Community Governance of Future Expansions:** Any future expansion of the AON token supply beyond the initial 20,000 tokens (and, consequently, the number of additional eSIMs) will be decided and governed entirely by the AON DAO through a transparent voting process. This ensures that ecosystem growth is always aligned with the community's vision and needs.

### 3. AON Token Utility

The AON token is multi-functional and acts as the central value enabler in the ecosystem:

* **Access to Lifetime Global Connectivity:** The primary right of each AON token holder is lifetime access to the global satellite and terrestrial eSIM connectivity.
* **Participation in Governance (DAO):** AON token holders have voting rights within the project's Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This allows them to participate in critical decisions regarding protocol development, development fund allocations, future supply expansions, and overall ecosystem strategy.
* **Rewards for PQC Validation and Active Participation:** Users who actively contribute to decentralized Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) validation within the AON network can earn tokens as a reward. **Every month, 35% of all revenue generated by user validation and ecosystem services will be distributed to AON token holders!** These funds can be withdrawn as fiat currency directly from the blockchain or their bank account, or used to access future services within the AON ecosystem. This active reward mechanism incentivizes network security and community engagement.
* **Access to Advanced Services and Staking (Future Potential):** The community may vote on the implementation of staking mechanisms where AON token holders can lock their tokens to gain increased governance rights, secure the network, or access advanced security features or premium services within the AON ecosystem.

### 4. Initial Supply Distribution (Phase 1 - 5,000 tokens)

The initial token allocation is designed to achieve a balance between liquidity, development, community rewards, and strategic funding:

* **Community & Rewards:** **35% (1,750 tokens)**. Allocated to reward early and high-value participation, open-source contributions, bug bounty programs, and active engagement in governance and community channels.
* **DEX Liquidity:** **30% (1,500 tokens)**. Allocated to provide initial liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), ensuring a healthy and accessible market for the AON token from launch. This is crucial for adoption and price discovery.
* **Private Sale:** **15% (750 tokens)**. Targeted at strategic investors and initial partners who bring capital and long-term value to the project. These funds will be used to drive development and expansion.
* **Team & Advisors:** **15% (750 tokens)**. Allocated to reward and retain the founding team and key advisors. These tokens will be subject to a rigorous vesting schedule (e.g., initial 6-12 month cliff, followed by linear release over an additional 2-4 years) to align their interests with the project's long-term success. Value-adjusted compensation post-initial vesting is contemplated, decided by the DAO to ensure talent retention.
* **Development Fund (DAO Treasury):** **5% (250 tokens)**. An initial fund to cover essential development expenses, PQC research, security audits (including ISO 31000), and critical operational needs. This fund will be managed and audited transparently by the DAO, ensuring the project's sustainability.

### 5. Sustainability Mechanisms and Token Burn

To ensure the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem and the token's value, key economic mechanisms will be implemented:

* **Transaction Fees:** Transactions within the AON ecosystem (e.g., token transfers, interactions with smart contracts related to services) will incur small fees.
* **Automatic Token Burn:** A portion of the generated fees will be subject to an **automatic burn**, permanently reducing the total token supply. This deflationary mechanism aims to increase scarcity and, potentially, the long-term value of the AON token. The exact proportion of fees allocated to burning will be defined and adjustable by community vote.
* **Development Fund/DAO Treasury:** A portion of the fees will be directed to the DAO Treasury to fund continuous development, bandwidth acquisition from satellite/terrestrial providers, and community rewards, ensuring a sustainable growth cycle.
* **Automated Liquidity (Potential):** A portion could be redirected to DEX liquidity pools, helping to maintain the depth and stability of the AON token's liquidity.

This tokenomics model is designed to create a robust, self-sustaining, and high-value ecosystem where the interests of token holders, developers, and the community align to drive AON's success.
