## Welcome to AON!

In a world where privacy is a luxury and cybersecurity a constant battle, **AON** emerges as the world's first **decentralized Artificial Intelligence** infrastructure. Designed to operate with unparalleled security, auditability, and resilience, AON protects critical infrastructures and democratizes global connectivity by integrating post-quantum security (PQM), ISO 31000 risk management, and lifetime connectivity into a single ecosystem.

## The Problem We Solve

[cite_start]Global critical infrastructures (finance, defense, health) are under increasing threat from sophisticated cyberattacks and the imminent arrival of quantum computing [cite: 6, 75-76, 77-79]. [cite_start]Current centralized AI solutions are inherently vulnerable, lack a unified global risk management framework (ISO 31000), and do not offer the necessary resilience for the most valuable assets [cite: 7, 54, 91-98]. Furthermore, global connectivity remains limited by geographical barriers, costly roaming, and recurring bills.

## Our Unique Solution: The Pillars of AON

[cite_start]AON offers an unprecedented value proposition based on the synergistic integration of advanced technologies and a decentralized governance model [cite: 9, 102-104]:

1.  [cite_start]**Lifetime Global Connectivity:** Each **AON token** represents a **lifetime global satellite and terrestrial eSIM connectivity**, eliminating barriers, recurring bills, and the need for contracts, symbolizing true personal sovereignty over connectivity [cite: 10, 58, 107-108].
2.  [cite_start]**Native Post-Quantum Security (PQM):** We implement cryptographic algorithms resistant to quantum attacks (Kyber, Dilithium) [cite: 12, 61, 114-116], ensuring the long-term integrity and confidentiality of data and communications, even against the threat of large-scale quantum computers.
3.  [cite_start]**Decentralized AI & ISO 31000 Risk Management:** A decentralized Artificial Intelligence engine enables **real-time anomaly detection and active forensic auditing** [cite: 13, 63, 117-119]. [cite_start]This is grounded in the integration of the international risk management standard ISO 31000 from design, ensuring regulatory compliance and indispensable trust [cite: 13, 59-60, 110-112].
4.  [cite_start]**Digital Sovereignty (SSI & Web3 DID) & End to CAPTCHAs:** Digital identity in AON is based on **Self-Sovereign Digital Identity (SSI)** principles and **Web3 Decentralized Identifiers (DID)** [cite: 14, 64, 121-123], guaranteeing full user control over their data. This robust identity verification **obsoletes the need for CAPTCHAs and reCAPTCHAs**, which currently consume approximately **7.5 million kWh of energy** and generate **7.5 million pounds of CO2** from data transmission alone, at an estimated cost of **over 1.5 million euros annually** for reCAPTCHAs' energy. AON eliminates this unnecessary cost and environmental impact.
5.  **Advanced Hybrid Architecture for Extreme Resilience:** Combining the immutability of **blockchain technology** with the resilience and global reach of **satellite networks and Web3 principles**. This enables uninterrupted operation even in conventional connectivity disruption scenarios, including robust Secure Mobile-Device Provisioning (SM-DP+) for identities and devices.
6.  [cite_start]**Expansion Strategy & Strategic Alliances:** Our model is designed for **interoperability** and **strategic collaboration** with established telecommunications companies and SM-DP+ providers [cite: 17, 18, 19, 68-69, 130-131]. This allows for faster and more efficient global scaling of AON eSIMs, while achieving **massive energy savings** for companies like Google (whose data centers consume **30.8 million MWh** annually) and governments, by reducing the need for redundant and centralized processing.

## The AON Token: Our Shared Value Model

The AON token is the economic engine of the ecosystem, designed to incentivize participation and ensure long-term sustainability.

* **Lifetime Connectivity Access:** Each token grants lifetime access to global satellite and terrestrial connectivity.
* [cite_start]**Decentralized Governance (DAO):** AON token holders vote on key decisions and the future of the project [cite: 28, 178-179].
* **Active Participation Rewards:** Users can earn AON tokens by actively participating in decentralized Post-Quantum Security (PQC) validation. **Every month, 35% of all revenue generated by user validation and ecosystem services will be distributed to AON token holders!** These funds can be withdrawn in fiat currency directly from the blockchain or their bank account, or used for future services within the AON ecosystem, directly incentivizing participation and value for the community.
* **Access to Advanced Services:** The community may decide if certain advanced security functionalities will require the use or staking of tokens.

## Tokenomics (Executive Summary)

* **Initial Supply (Phase 1):** 5,000 AON tokens.
* [cite_start]**Controlled Expansion:** Total projected supply of **20,000 AON tokens** in controlled phases to fund global infrastructure growth [cite: 11, 27, 171-177]. [cite_start]Any future expansion will be decided by the DAO [cite: 28, 178-179].
* **Distribution (Phase 1 - 5,000 tokens):**
    * Community & Rewards: 35%
    * DEX Liquidity: 30%
    * Private Sale: 15%
    * Team & Advisors: 15% (with rigorous vesting)
    * Development Fund (DAO Treasury): 5%
* [cite_start]**Sustainability:** Transaction fees fund development, rewards, and an **automatic token burn** to ensure long-term scarcity and sustainability [cite: 35, 181-187].
