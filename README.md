Pitch for Decentralized AI Project with ISO 31000 & PQM Security

1. Current Problem

Critical infrastructures (finance, defense, healthcare) are increasingly exposed to cyber risks and future quantum attacks. Current AI solutions are centralized, do not comply with international risk management standards, and are vulnerable to the next generation of attacks.

2. Our Unique Solution

We are the first decentralized AI that integrates:

    ISO 31000 Certification: The international risk management standard, ensuring compliance and trust for enterprise and governmental adoption.

    Post-Quantum Security (PQM): Proven resistance against quantum computing attacks, guaranteeing long-term integrity and confidentiality.

    Advanced Hybrid Architecture: Blockchain + satellite networks + Web3, to operate even outside conventional internet.

3. Target Market

    Governments and Defense: Secure and auditable artificial intelligence systems.

    Financial Institutions: AI-driven risk management and regulatory compliance.

    Technology Companies: A platform to build decentralized and secure AI applications.

4. Tokenomics Model

    Total Supply: 1,000M tokens.

    Private Sale: 15%.

    Team and Advisors: 15% with vesting.

    Development Fund: 5%.

    DEX Liquidity: 30%.

    Community and Rewards: 35%.

    Transactions with fees that fund development, rewards, and automatic burning for sustainability.

5. Roadmap (4-8 months)

    Month 1-2: Smart contract development and audit + functional AI MVP with PQM.

    Month 3: Private sale launch with investor presentations and initial partners.

    Month 4: Public announcement with open-source repository + pre-launch ISO 31000 certification.

    Month 5-8: Community expansion, strategic alliances, final certification, and advanced development.

6. Competitive Advantage

    First in the world with decentralized AI + ISO 31000 + PQM.

    Focus on real security, auditability, and compliance, not just technological hype.

    Hybrid integration for resilience across satellite and mesh networks.

7. Investment Request

We seek to raise between €50,000 and €100,000 for:

    ISO certification and security audits.

    Advanced technological development.

    Marketing strategy and community growth.
